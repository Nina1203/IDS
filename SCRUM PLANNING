How we'll approach the project using the Scrum framework:

1. To-Do List:We'll start by making a list of all the things we need to do to build the web application. This list will help us stay organized and focused.

2. Planning Meetings: Every few weeks, we'll have a meeting to decide what tasks we'll work on next. We'll pick the most important ones and break them down into smaller steps.

3. Daily Check-ins:Every day, we'll have a quick meeting to talk about what we worked on yesterday, what we're doing today, and if we need any help.

4. Show and Tell:At the end of each few weeks, we'll show what we've built to the client. They can give us feedback, and we can make any necessary changes.

5. Learning and Improving:After each show-and-tell meeting, we'll have a chat about what went well and what we can do better next time.

6. Building a Little at a Time:Instead of trying to do everything at once, we'll build the web application bit by bit. This way, we can make sure everything works as it should.

7. Team Roles: Each person on the team will have a specific role. Someone will be in charge of deciding what needs to be done, someone else will help keep things running smoothly, and the rest of us will focus on building the web application.
Following these steps, we'll be able to work together effectively and create a great web application for our client.
